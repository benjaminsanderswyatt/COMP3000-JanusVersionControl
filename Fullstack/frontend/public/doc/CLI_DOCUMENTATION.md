## Overview

Janus is a version control CLI that:

- **Manages repository configuration:** Adjust repository properties with `config`.
- **Supports local version control:** Stage changes using `add`, commit with `commit`, and view commit logs and differences.
- **Manages branches:** Create, list, switch, merge branches, and revert to previous commits.
- **Handles authentication:** Use `login` to store your credentials for remote repositories.
- **Remote repository interactions:** Clone, fetch, pull, and push changes with remote repositories.

---

## Getting Started

Before using most commands, ensure you have done the following:

- Installed Janus on your system.
- Log in with your credentials using the `janus login` command.
- Initialised a repository with `janus init` if not already done.

## Workflow and Usage Tips

- **Initialization:**  
  Always start with `janus init` in a new project directory.

- **Making Changes:**  
  Use `janus add` to stage new or modified files, then commit using `janus commit` with a descriptive message.

- **Branch Management:**  
  Use `janus create_branch` to start new features and `janus switch_branch` to safely change to the new branch. Display existing branches with `janus list_branch`.

- **Remote Operations:**  
  Clone repositories from a remote source with `janus clone`. Keep your repository up to date by using `janus fetch`, `janus pull`, and `janus push`.

- **Version History:**  
  Review commit history with `janus log` and compare commit differences using `janus diff`.

- **Handling Conflicts and Reverts:**  
  Merge with `janus merge` or revert using `janus revert`.

## Plugin System

Janus supports an extensible plugin architecture that allows developers to add custom commands by placing compiled `.dll` files into the designated plugin folders.

### How It Works

At startup, Janus loads all built in commands and scans for external plugin assemblies located in:

- **Local Plugins:**  
  `<project-root>/.janus/plugins`

- **Global Plugins:**  
  `<user-home>/Janus/plugins`

Each plugin must implement the `ICommand` interface defined in `Janus.Plugins`.

### ICommand Interface

```csharp
public interface ICommand
{
    string Name { get; }
    string Description { get; }
    string Usage { get; }
    Task Execute(string[] args);
}
```

### BaseCommand (Convenience Class)

For easier plugin creation, extend the BaseCommand class which provides access to logging and paths:

```csharp
public abstract class BaseCommand : ICommand
{
    protected ILogger Logger { get; }
    protected Paths Paths { get; }

    public BaseCommand(ILogger logger, Paths paths)
    {
        Logger = logger ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(logger));
        Paths = paths ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(paths));
    }

    public abstract string Name { get; }
    public abstract string Description { get; }
    public abstract string Usage { get; }
    public abstract Task Execute(string[] args);
}
```
### Example Plugin

Below is an example of a simple plugin that outputs "hello world":
```csharp
using Janus.Plugins;

namespace PluginDemo
{
    public class PluginDemo : BaseCommand
    {
        public PluginDemo(ILogger logger, Paths paths) : base(logger, paths) { }

        public override string Name => "plugin";
        public override string Description => "A demo command for plugins";
        public override string Usage =>
@"janus plugin
This command shows:
    - Says hello world
Example:
    janus plugin";

        public override async Task Execute(string[] args)
        {
            Logger.Log("Plugin Demo - hello world");
        }
    }
}
```

### Using Plugin Commands

Once the plugin is compiled into a `.dll` and placed in the plugin directory, the command is picked up by Janus to be used.

- Run janus help to see the added plugin command listed.
- Execute the plugin command as you would with any built in command:

## Additional Notes

- **User Prompts:**  
  Some commands require confirmation (e.g., `switch_branch`, `pull`, `revert`).

- **Configuration:**  
  Use `config` for managing IP settings and repo metadata.

- **Error Logs:**  
  Errors and conflicts are logged to assist in troubleshooting.
  
- **Plugin Developer Guide:**  
  For more detailed information on developing plugins, refer to the Plugin Developer Guide.
