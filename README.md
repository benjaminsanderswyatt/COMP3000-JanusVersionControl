# Janus - Distributed Version Control System
Janus is a secure, self-hosted Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) designed for enterprises. It eliminates reliance on external cloud services, allowing organisations to maintain full control over sensitive codebases within internal networks. Built with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Dockerised web interface, Janus prioritizes security, extensibility, and compliance.

### Key Features
- On-Premise Deployment: Host repositories internally for GDPR/Data Protection Act compliance.
- Plugin Architecture: Extend functionality with custom plugins.
- Granular Access Control: Native RBAC and revocable Personal Access Tokens (PATs).
- Dockerised Microservices: Containerised frontend, backend, and database.
- Cross-Platform CLI: Fast, intuitive command-line tool for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Audit Logging: Comprehensive logs for compliance and traceability.


## Technologies

### Dockerised Architecture

- Frontend: A responsive, user-friendly web interface providing secure access to repository data and management tools.
- Backend: RESTful endpoints supporting CLI and web interactions, handling authentication, audit logging, and data processing.
- Database: Secure storage of user accounts, repository metadata, and audit logs.

### Local CLI

- The Command Line Interface (CLI) is the core of Janusâ€™s local operations and supports essential DVCS workflows:
- Repository initialization (creates a hidden .janus/ directory for version control).
- File staging and commit history logging.
- Branch management, merging, and conflict detection.
- Pushing and pulling changes to/from the internal remote repository.

### Plugin Framework

- The plugin architecture enabling developers to add custom commandsto the CLI.
- Adapt Janus to evolving enterprise workflows without modifying core code.
